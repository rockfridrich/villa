{"id":"villa-h74","title":"[Proposal] Evaluate Memvid for AI context management","description":"## Summary\n\nEvaluate [Memvid](https://memvid.com/) as a context management layer for:\n1. **Claude Code development context** (`.claude/` knowledge base)\n2. **User agent context in TinyCloud** (user preferences, history)\n\n## What is Memvid?\n\nMemvid is a portable AI memory system that replaces vector databases with a single file. Two implementations exist:\n\n| Version | Format | Embeddings | Features |\n|---------|--------|------------|----------|\n| [Python (original)](https://github.com/Olow304/memvid) | `.mp4` (QR codes in video) | SentenceTransformers + FAISS | 50-100x smaller than vector DBs |\n| [Rust (new)](https://github.com/memvid/memvid) | `.mv2` (single file) | ONNX + HNSW | Sub-5ms retrieval, MCP server |\n\n### Key Benefits\n- **Single-file portable**: No database infrastructure needed\n- **Offline-capable**: Works entirely locally after initial indexing\n- **MCP integration**: [memvid_mcp_server](https://github.com/angrysky56/memvid_mcp_server) exposes tools to Claude\n- **Sub-5ms search**: Fast semantic retrieval\n\n## Can It Work With 500MB Local Qwen?\n\n**⚠️ Critical misunderstanding to clarify:**\n\nMemvid needs an **embedding model**, NOT a chat LLM. These are different:\n\n| Model Type | Purpose | Example | Size |\n|------------|---------|---------|------|\n| **Chat LLM** | Generate text responses | Qwen-0.5B, Qwen-1.8B | 500MB-2GB |\n| **Embedding Model** | Convert text → vectors | Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B | ~600MB |\n\n### Embedding Options for Local Use\n\n| Model | Size | Format | Notes |\n|-------|------|--------|-------|\n| [Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B-ONNX](https://huggingface.co/onnx-community/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B-ONNX) | ~600MB (q8: ~300MB) | ONNX | Multilingual, 100+ languages |\n| [all-MiniLM-L6-v2](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2) | ~90MB | PyTorch/ONNX | Smaller, English-focused |\n| [Model2Vec distilled](https://huggingface.co/futur/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B-model2vec-onnx) | \u003c50MB | ONNX | 500x faster, lower quality |\n\n**Answer:** Yes, but you need an embedding model alongside (or instead of) your chat LLM.\n\n## Use Case Analysis\n\n### 1. `.claude/` Development Context ✅ VIABLE\n\n**What it could do:**\n- Index all specs, learnings, reflections into one `.mv2` file\n- Enable semantic search over project knowledge\n- Persist context between sessions\n- MCP server exposes tools for RAG-style queries\n\n**Integration path:**\n```\nspecs/ + .claude/LEARNINGS.md + reflections/\n    ↓ (index once)\n.claude/context.mv2 (single file)\n    ↓ (MCP server)\nClaude Code queries via tool calls\n```\n\n**Pros:**\n- Better context retrieval than file search\n- Survives compaction/session clears\n- Single portable file\n\n**Cons:**\n- Adds complexity (embedding model + memvid runtime)\n- Re-indexing needed when docs change\n- MCP server is separate process to manage\n\n### 2. TinyCloud User Agent Context ❌ MISALIGNED\n\n**Why this doesn't fit:**\n\nTinyCloud and Memvid solve different problems:\n\n| Aspect | TinyCloud | Memvid |\n|--------|-----------|--------|\n| **Purpose** | Decentralized user data storage | AI memory/RAG |\n| **Data** | Avatars, profiles, settings | Text chunks + embeddings |\n| **Search** | Key-value lookup | Semantic similarity |\n| **User-facing** | Yes | No (AI tool) |\n\n**Current TinyCloud usage in Villa:**\n- Custom avatar uploads (images)\n- Cross-device profile sync\n\n**What \"user agent context\" would need:**\n- User preferences, chat history, behavioral patterns\n- This is application state, not semantic memory\n- Better served by database + simple key-value storage\n\n**Recommendation:** Don't force Memvid into TinyCloud. They're orthogonal.\n\n## Cost/Benefit Analysis\n\n### For `.claude/` Context\n\n| Factor | Assessment |\n|--------|------------|\n| **Setup effort** | Medium (install embedding model, run MCP server) |\n| **Maintenance** | Low (re-index on doc changes) |\n| **Value** | Medium (better than grep, worse than Claude's native understanding) |\n| **Risk** | Low (purely optional tooling) |\n\n### For TinyCloud User Context\n\n| Factor | Assessment |\n|--------|------------|\n| **Setup effort** | High (would need custom integration layer) |\n| **Maintenance** | High (sync issues, embedding drift) |\n| **Value** | Low (overkill for user preferences) |\n| **Risk** | Medium (adds complexity to user-facing path) |\n\n## Recommendation\n\n### Do: Experiment with `.claude/` context\n\n1. Install memvid MCP server locally\n2. Index `specs/` and `.claude/LEARNINGS.md`\n3. Test retrieval quality over 1-2 weeks\n4. If valuable, document as optional developer tool\n\n### Don't: Integrate with TinyCloud\n\n- TinyCloud is for user data (avatars, profiles)\n- User \"context\" is better served by:\n  - Session storage (ephemeral preferences)\n  - Database (persistent preferences)\n  - Browser localStorage (device-specific)\n\n## Decision Points\n\n**Before proceeding:**\n1. Is semantic search over project docs actually a pain point?\n2. Do we have the ~600MB budget for an embedding model?\n3. Who maintains the MCP server process?\n4. Is the value worth the complexity?\n\n## Resources\n\n- [Memvid Documentation](https://docs.memvid.com)\n- [GitHub: memvid/memvid (Rust)](https://github.com/memvid/memvid)\n- [GitHub: Olow304/memvid (Python)](https://github.com/Olow304/memvid)\n- [Memvid MCP Server](https://github.com/angrysky56/memvid_mcp_server)\n- [Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B-ONNX](https://huggingface.co/onnx-community/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B-ONNX)","status":"open","priority":3,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-07T00:52:59.476271+07:00","created_by":"me","updated_at":"2026-01-07T01:02:37.233884+07:00"}
