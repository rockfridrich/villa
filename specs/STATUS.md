### Implementation Notes

Porto SDK provides:
- Real Ethereum wallet addresses (not hash-derived)
- Passkey management, cross-device sync
- Built-in recovery (social, email, OAuth)
- Theming via ThemeFragment (60+ tokens)

Villa controls:
- Welcome screen, profile setup, home screen
- Error messages and retry flows
- Theme colors applied to Porto dialogs

Porto controls (security-critical):
- Passkey creation/authentication prompts
- Transaction signing UI
- Key management

## Phase 2: Recovery [NEXT]

Self-sovereign account recovery.

- Face recovery (Unforgettable SDK)
- Guardian setup
- ZK social recovery
- QR/Bluetooth signing

## Phase 3: Community [LATER]

Privacy-preserving community features.

- ZK membership proofs
- Community map (OpenStreetMap)
- Check-in / presence

## Phase 4: AI [FUTURE]

Local-first AI assistant.

- Local AI (WebLLM)
- Cloud AI (with consent)
